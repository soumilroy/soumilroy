==================================================================================================================================

I’m a Software Engineer focused on building and owning end-to-end systems, from initial design through production. I work primarily with Golang, Python, and JavaScript, and have hands-on experience designing, deploying, and operating cloud native systems on Microsoft Azure.

I’m comfortable taking full ownership of solutions. covering architecture, implementation, deployment, and operational concerns such as reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
